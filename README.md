# 🧠 Face Detection and Recognition using CNN and OpenCV

## 📖 Overview
This project is a **real-time face detection and recognition system** built using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **OpenCV**.  
The system captures face images through an **IP Webcam**, trains a CNN model on them, and later recognizes and displays the **person's name** during live video streaming.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- 📸 Capture face images via IP Webcam  
- 🧠 Train the captured images using a CNN model  
- 👁️ Real-time face detection and recognition  
- 🧾 Display recognized person’s name on the live video  
- 💾 Model and dataset storage for reuse  

---

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **TensorFlow / Keras**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **IP Webcam (Android / Network Camera)**

---

## 🏗️ Workflow
1. **Image Capture:**  
   Faces are captured from the IP webcam using OpenCV and stored in a local dataset folder.

2. **Model Training:**  
   A CNN model is trained on the collected dataset for facial recognition.

3. **Face Detection & Recognition:**  
   The trained model identifies faces in real-time video streams and labels them with their corresponding names.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/face-detection-recognition.git
   cd face-detection-recognition
````

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the image capture script

   ```bash
   python capture_images.py
   ```

4. Train the CNN model

   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

5. Start real-time face recognition

   ```bash
   python recognize_face.py
   ```
